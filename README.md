#Mood_Lamp
=========
Coded by Edwin L. and Pingda L.

Arduino program that will  

##Installation
 Make sure you have the moodLamp.ino file.  
If you have Arduino ERW 1.0.5  or newer, to run the program, simply run the ino file.  
An error popup will appear if your Arduino ERW is not up to date.  
In that case, you must update your java at http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

##Getting Started
 Open up the file and press run. Make sure that the arduino is connected to the computer properly and all wires and pins are functional.
 
##Features/Notes:
* Contains a bi-directional motor, potentiometer, a multicolour LED, and Piezo pins which are controlled by taking in user input. 
*	There should be 3 buttons on the moodlamp for user input, 2 inside and 1 on the outside. 
 * The outside button controls power and turns on the Moodlamp
 * The inside buttons will control the lights and music being displayed, allowing the user to rotate through the different modes
*	When turned on the bidirectional motor will open up the Moodlamp by lifting up the cover of the Moodlamp
*	There are 4 different moods for the user to rotate from, each having different light and different music
 * Action, sad, happy, and random
* Random mode will display random colours and random notes (Warning eyes may hurt)
* The music played will be Mission Impossible, Still Alive, and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.
* Pressing the power button again will turn off the Moodlamp
      
##Limitations and Future Updates: 
* Time was the main limiting factor with side factors being the materials used for the Moodlamp
* Future Updates could include adding more motors to allow for a spinning lamp, adding more LEDs that could display different colours
